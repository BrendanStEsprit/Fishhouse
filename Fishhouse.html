	<h2>Our Mission</h2>
<p>In Florida Fish House we want to give you the sensation of actually living in florida, to do this we keep the air conditioning at 90 degrees every day of the year and on occasion the staff will set the fire alam to give all of our visitors the true florida experence.We beleive that our food should have the freshest ingredents so we get all of our food straight from New York City and our meat is not approved by the FDA</p>
<h2>Events</h2>
	<p>We host daily aligator wrestilng competitions, don't worry; we train all of our alligators to not hurt our customers.We also hold monthly hardcore bingo competitions, however, all grandmas are banned from competition because they were too overpowered.</p>
